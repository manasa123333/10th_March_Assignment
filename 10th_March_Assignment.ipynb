    "Point estimation involves using sample data to calculate a single value estimate of a population parameter. For example, the sample mean is a point estimate of the population mean. Other common point estimators include the sample median, mode, and standard deviation.                                                              \n",

    "Interval estimation involves using sample data to construct a range of values within which the population parameter is likely to fall. This range of values is known as a confidence interval. Confidence intervals are constructed using a statistical procedure known as confidence interval estimation. The confidence level of a confidence interval is the percentage of times that the confidence interval will contain the true population parameter, if the experiment is repeated many times."
